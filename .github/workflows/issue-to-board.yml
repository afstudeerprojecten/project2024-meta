            <summary>If you didn't add the 'not-on-board' label...</summary>

              I put issues and pull requests without the 'not-on-board' on the board, label your next issue with the 'not-on-board' label if you don't want this!
              I clean up the not-on-board tag myself, so don't worry about that.
              The issue right now is that I can't really clean up the board, so you'll have to do that yourself. Sorry :(
